<h1>Javascript 이란 무엇인가?</h1>
<h2>Javascript</h2>

<p>
    JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic elements on websites. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web and is supported by all modern web browsers.

JavaScript was initially developed by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications in the mid-1990s. It was originally called LiveScript but was later renamed to JavaScript to capitalize on the popularity of Java at that time. Despite the name similarity, JavaScript and Java are two distinct programming languages.

JavaScript is often used for tasks such as adding interactivity to web pages, manipulating and validating form data, creating animations, handling asynchronous requests, and building web applications. It is known for its versatility and can be used both on the client-side (in web browsers) and on the server-side (with the help of frameworks like Node.js).

One of the key features of JavaScript is its ability to dynamically modify web page content and respond to user actions without requiring a page reload. This is achieved through a technique called DOM manipulation, where JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page to modify its structure, content, or appearance.

Over the years, JavaScript has evolved significantly and has become an essential language for web development. It has a wide range of frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, that simplify the process of building complex web applications. Additionally, JavaScript has expanded beyond the web and is now used for server-side development, mobile app development, and even desktop application development.
